Data Science? Make It Spatial
=============================

This is a talk given by Angela Li of the [Center for Spatial Data Science (CSDS)](https://spatial.uchicago.edu) at UChicago for [DC R Conference 2018](https://rstats.ai). The goal was to introduce spatial analysis methods to a crowd that was deeply familiar with R, but new to spatial analysis.

Below are the slides from the talk. The shortlink to the slides is [bit.ly/dc-spatial](bit.ly/dc-spatial) for easy reference.
